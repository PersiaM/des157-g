  <h2>Designing for culture shock</h2>
  <p>Migration has existed during the history of human kind. Ancient tribes moved from one place to another in search of food, more fertile lands and better climates. In today’s modern world, there are many reasons for humans’ migrations from one country to another such as economic gaps between countries, natural catastrophes, educational opportunities, political freedom, etc. For instance, globalization has increased the human’s mobility along with goods for economic reasons. Human rights issues as a main factor for political migration has been in the center of debated and attention for both leaders and individual members of societies. The current violations of human rights around the world has caused many deaths and dislocation of humans which made an increase in immigrants and refugee rates. There are many problems immigrants and refugees face during migration and post migration such as trauma, stress, anxiety, etc. Leaving a familiar culture and getting exposed to a new environment and a new culture is indeed a stressful and confusing stage of the immigration process, which is clinically referred to as culture shock.</p>

<h2>The Research</h2>
<p>This project explores the common phenomenon of culture shock and the role of design in helping immigrants and refugees with the transitional problems related to cultural differences post migration. The behavioral, physical and psychological reactions to the new environment caused by culture shock can be confusing to immigrants and refugees specially if they are unaware of the four different stages of adjustment known as the honeymoon stage, the frustration stage, the adjustment stage and the acceptance stage.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>This project particularly addresses the problems middle eastern immigrants and refugees face post migration, since the new environment can be very challenging for new comers with different backgrounds and language barrier. The research phase of this project focuses on discovering the patterns of targeted audience’s experiences in relation to culture shock by gathering information through oral history and group interviews, participatory workshops, prototyping and user testing which ultimately helps in designing an internet based interactive graphic novel that creates a better experience by providing information about the culture shock theory and studied scenarios.</p>
<h2>The Outcome</h2>
<p>The goal for this project is to create a platform for immigrants and refugees to help them better understand the theory of culture shock since lack of information in this area results in stress and confusion. The format of this project allows for accessibility and further use by different audiences while the design, illustrations, content, and interactive scenarios create an appealing interface for the targeted audience.</p>
