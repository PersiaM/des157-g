    <div class="dis"><p>Migration has existed during the history of human kind. In
today’s modern world, there are many reasons for humans’
migrations from one country to another.
However, leaving a familiar culture and getting exposed to a
new environment is indeed a stressful and confusing stage
of the immigration process, which is clinically referred to as
culture shock.
In this informational website, I am particularly addressing
the
problems middle eastern immigrants face during
and post migration through storytelling by collecting the
stories of targeted audience’s experiences in relation to
culture differences and challenges they faced throughout
their journey.
This website is an internet based interactive graphic novel
that tells stories of immigrant’s journeys and how they
overcame challenges and found cultural balance in the new
environment.</p></div>
